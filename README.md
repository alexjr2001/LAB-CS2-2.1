# LAB-CS2-2.1

We are in front of my first repository of GitHub, these are my first steps into this hosting platform and also in the Git environment (Bash) during my second semester in the San Pablo University. Furthermore, this is the first time I see C++ (previously I had been programming with python). That's why we're gonna see some basic programs to get to know more of this compiler language. All the text printed in the console in this repository is written in Spanish, the directories as well, but don't worry we will explain them for a better understanding.

## Directories Explained
This project is divided for weeks, therefore we are going to pair each one of them with their translations:
 + "Primera semana" ⮕ [First week](https://github.com/alexjr2001/LAB-CS2-2.1/tree/master/PrimeraSemana)
 + "Semana13al17deAbril" ⮕ [Week between April 13-17](https://github.com/alexjr2001/LAB-CS2-2.1/tree/master/Semana13al17deAbril) (Second Week)
 + "Semana20al24deAbril" ⮕ [Week between April 20-24](https://github.com/alexjr2001/LAB-CS2-2.1/tree/master/PrimeraSemana) (Third Week)
 + "Semana27al03deMayo" ⮕ [Week between May 27-03](https://github.com/alexjr2001/LAB-CS2-2.1/tree/master/PrimeraSemana) (Fourth Week)

Maybe in code you'll find Spanish text like this one: 
```
std::cout << "Cual es tu nombre? "; 
```
Don't worry it doesn't affect the understanding of how the .cpp file works.
